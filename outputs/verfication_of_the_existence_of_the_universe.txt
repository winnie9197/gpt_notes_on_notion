Verification of the existence of the universe is a topic that has been debated for centuries. It is a question that many people have asked, but very few have been able to answer. But now, thanks to advances in technology and science, we have been able to verify the existence of the universe. 

One of the most convincing pieces of evidence for the existence of the universe is the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). This is a low-level electromagnetic radiation that is present everywhere in the universe and is believed to be the remnant energy from the Big Bang, which is the event that is thought to have created the universe. The CMBR is so uniform throughout the universe, that it can be used to verify that the universe is indeed a single entity and not something that was created by multiple events. 

Another way to verify the existence of the universe is by looking at the structures of galaxies. Astronomers have been able to observe that galaxies are arranged in clusters and filaments, which are the same structures that are predicted by the Big Bang theory. This is further evidence that the universe was created in a single event and not multiple ones.

Finally, the presence of dark matter and dark energy is another strong indicator of the universe
